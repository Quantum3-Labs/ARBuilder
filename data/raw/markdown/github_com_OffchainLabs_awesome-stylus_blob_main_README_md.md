#### How to make this code compatible with stylus-sdk v0.5.0
[](https://github.com/OffchainLabs/awesome-stylus/blob/main/README.md#how-to-make-this-code-compatible-with-stylus-sdk-v050)
When trying to use the latest version of `cargo stylus` on a project created first on cs v0.2.x you might run into this error:
```
missing import pay_for_memory_grow

```

To make the code compatible with the latest version, you might need to update the stylus-sdk version used to v0.5.0

#### How to make this code compatible with stylus-sdk v0.5.0
[](https://github.com/OffchainLabs/awesome-stylus/blob/main/README.md#how-to-make-this-code-compatible-with-stylus-sdk-v050-1)
When trying to use the latest version of `cargo stylus` on a project created first on cs v0.1.x you might run into this error:
```
error: no library targets found in package `your-package-name`

```

Here are some tips for making this code compatible with the latest version:
  * Use `lib.rs` instead of `main.rs` for the main logic of your program
  * Add also a `[lib]` target to your Cargo.toml file if you don't have one
  * Update the stylus-sdk version used to v0.5.0
  * Modify the function names from `camelCase` to `snake_case`
