Building applications on the Ethereum blockchain today can be extremely challenging. The potential is unlimited, but the barriers are steep. Writing smart contracts requires a deep knowledge of Solidity, and to get started, teams need to create and maintain complex infrastructure such as wallets, 
## What is thirdweb?
thirdweb is a web3 development platform that enables developers to easily spin up wallets, deploy secure and audited smart contracts, set up crypto payments, bridge assets across chains and query live onchain data without having to manage infrastructure or be a Solidity expert. This means that even non-crypto-native teams will easily be able to create reliable products on the blockchain. 
The team at thirdweb noticed that in the blockchain space, very few teams end up shipping applications. Many teams waste time reinventing common blockchain components such as token contracts, payment flows, and airdrop mechanics, and leave very little space for actual innovation.
## How thirdweb is Building with Stylus
thirdweb and [_Arbitrum Stylus_](https://arbitrum.io/stylus?ref=blog.arbitrum.io) were a natural fit for each other, with both sharing the mission to make blockchain development more accessible. Stylus enables smart contracts to be written in Rust, C, C++, and other WebAssembly (WASM) languages while remaining completely EVM compatible, expanding the pool of developers who can write performant contracts. By integrating with Stylus, thirdweb was able to allow experienced teams to push onchain efficiency further on Arbitrum.
> “Stylus enhances and transforms the developer experience with language interoperability, performant execution, and cost-efficient tools. These benefits make airdrops, proofs, and other contracts more efficient as the underlying tech for apps looking to scale,” Yash Kumar, engineer at thirdweb, said.
Using Stylus, thirdweb was able to design more efficient airdrop contracts that supported 
Stylus’s benefits are especially apparent in compute-heavy scenarios. thirdweb has observed meaningful gas savings with Stylus when running hashing, parsing, and Merkle proof verification inside contracts. Specifically, the team has seen around 10% gas savings on Merkle claim computations, up to half a million gas saved in large push-based airdrops, and cheaper EIP-712 hashing. Although storage I/O still dominates overall costs, Stylus has been able to deliver measurable efficiency gains. 
“We have seen gas savings on compute-heavy code that actually does work,” Kumar said. “This is where our Merkle verification and EIP-712 hashing benefit most.”
## What’s Next for thirdweb?
thirdweb has already shipped full tooling support for Stylus, alongside template contracts and prebuilt airdrop flows. The team is currently working on zero-knowledge-based minting contracts and modular minting components, both of which will benefit from Stylus. 
Developers who are interested in deploying prebuilt Stylus contracts are encouraged to explore
