Why another layer?
Why do we need another layer? Superposition approaches building a layer in mechanism first approach, that goes beyond the typical value propositions of _just_ speed and cost-efficiency. It's a layer where liquidity and utility are not just coexisting but are interwoven into the chain, ensuring that every transaction is more than just a transfer of value—it's an integral part of a larger, self-sustaining economy, that is aligned. There are a few approaches currently being taken by others who are building native-yield layers. Superposition goes beyond just native yield being offered on the chain, Superposition's introduces novel mechanisms which include; native token distribution models, yield through utility and shared liquidity.

Solving Incentive Misalignment
Applications now drive onchain activity, yet chains limit applications into sandboxes while revenue and users are driven by applications. Superposition flips this model - creating a chain where applications are first-class citizens that directly benefit from the value they create.
### 
[](https://docs.superposition.so/introduction/understanding-superposition#growth-for-everyone)
Growth for Everyone
Traditionally, liquidity has been zero sum, as certain winners on a chain emerge, they siphon liquidity from other applications. On Superposition we promote shared liquidity that is accessible by every application. Through a shared order book called the Longtail, when certain applications experience expansive growth, it benefits every application on the chain. 
###

Decentralisation through Utility
Many chains suffer from finding ways to progressively decentralise and distribute ownership. Superposition offers native token distribution through Super Assets and Utility Mining. As users use an application, the Super Layer can distribute tokens to users of an application natively. This allows a seamless user experience and alignment between user ownership and value given.
###

Applications Now Drive Chains 
Instead of chains constraining applications, Superposition enables:
  * Applications to capture their own MEV through Super Assets
  * Shared liquidity that grows with ecosystem usage
  * Progressive decentralisation through Utility Mining
  * Direct revenue capture for developers

Low & Negative Fees
Superposition and its primitives are built on top of the EVM+ Arbitrum Nitro Stack implementing Arbitrum Stylus, resulting in Computation being over 10x more efficient and memory over 100x. 
This paired up with Superposition's native active and passive on-chain rewards results in not only a fast experience when using different dApps, but one that actually pays you to use and explore them.

Multiple yield sources power the Super Layer:
  * Money markets and RWAs for base yield
  * Longtail's CLOB Vault for trading fees
  * Cross-chain arbitrage opportunities
  * Application-specific revenue streams
