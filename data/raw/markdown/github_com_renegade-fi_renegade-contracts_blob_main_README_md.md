This repository contains the solidity code for Renegade's settlement contracts. The contracts encapsulate the Merklized exchange state, PlonK verifier, and settlement logic which together compose the Renegade darkpool.

## Contract Development Setup
[](https://github.com/renegade-fi/renegade-contracts/blob/main/README.md#contract-development-setup)
### Setup Foundry
[](https://github.com/renegade-fi/renegade-contracts/blob/main/README.md#setup-foundry)
```
curl -L https://foundry.paradigm.xyz | bash
```

### Install `huffc`
[](https://github.com/renegade-fi/renegade-contracts/blob/main/README.md#install-huffc)
```
curl -L get.huff.sh | bash
```

### Install Cargo
[](https://github.com/renegade-fi/renegade-contracts/blob/main/README.md#install-cargo)
The integration tests are written in rust, and the unit test use rust reference implementations:
```
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
```

### Clone the repo
[](https://github.com/renegade-fi/renegade-contracts/blob/main/README.md#clone-the-repo)
```
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/renegade-fi/renegade-solidity-contracts
```

## Running unit tests
[](https://github.com/renegade-fi/renegade-contracts/blob/main/README.md#running-unit-tests)
```
forge test --ffi -vv
```

## Running integration tests
[](https://github.com/renegade-fi/renegade-contracts/blob/main/README.md#running-integration-tests)
Assuming you have installed foundry and cargo, you can run the integration tests directly with:
```
./scripts/run-integration-tests.sh --release
```

This will:
  1. Start an `anvil` node
  2. Deploy the Renegade contracts to the node
  3. Run the integration tests against the node. These tests simulate a rust-based client interacting with the darkpool.


## Development Tools
[](https://github.com/renegade-fi/renegade-contracts/blob/main/README.md#development-tools)
The repository includes several helpful tools for development and deployment.
### Deploying Contracts
[](https://github.com/renegade-fi/renegade-contracts/blob/main/README.md#deploying-contracts)
To deploy Renegade contracts to an EVM chain:
```
./script/bin/deploy.sh --rpc-url <RPC_URL> --pkey <PRIVATE_KEY>
```

This will prompt for any missing configuration values like fee rates and contract addresses.
### Deploying Test Tokens
[](https://github.com/renegade-fi/renegade-contracts/blob/main/README.md#deploying-test-tokens)
For testing purposes, you can deploy dummy ERC20 tokens or a WETH mock:
```
# Deploy a regular ERC20 token (will prompt for name, symbol, and decimals)
./script/bin/deploy-token.sh --rpc-url <RPC_URL> --pkey <PRIVATE_KEY>

# Deploy a WETH mock
./script/bin/deploy-token.sh --rpc-url <RPC_URL> --pkey <PRIVATE_KEY> --weth
```

You can also specify token details directly:
```
# Deploy with all parameters specified
./script/bin/deploy-token.sh --rpc-url <RPC_URL> --pkey <PRIVATE_KEY> --name "My Token" --symbol "TKN" --decimals 18
```
