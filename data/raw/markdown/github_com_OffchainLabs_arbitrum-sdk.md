# Arbitrum SDK
[](https://github.com/OffchainLabs/arbitrum-sdk#arbitrum-sdk)
A TypeScript library for client-side interactions with Arbitrum. The Arbitrum SDK provides essential helper functionality and direct access to underlying smart contract interfaces, enabling developers to build powerful applications on the Arbitrum network.
This is the code and documentation for `@arbitrum/sdk` v4.
If you're looking for v3, check out [this branch](https://github.com/OffchainLabs/arbitrum-sdk/tree/v3).
If you're looking to migrate from v3 to v4, check out [this guide](https://github.com/OffchainLabs/arbitrum-sdk/blob/main/docs/2-migrate.mdx).

## Overview
[](https://github.com/OffchainLabs/arbitrum-sdk#overview)
Arbitrum SDK simplifies the process of interacting with Arbitrum chains, offering a robust set of tools for asset bridging and cross-chain messaging.
## Installation
[](https://github.com/OffchainLabs/arbitrum-sdk#installation)
```
npm install @arbitrum/sdk

# or

yarn add @arbitrum/sdk
```

## Key Features
[](https://github.com/OffchainLabs/arbitrum-sdk#key-features)
### Bridging Assets
[](https://github.com/OffchainLabs/arbitrum-sdk#bridging-assets)
Arbitrum SDK facilitates the bridging of assets between an Arbitrum chain and its parent chain. Currently supported asset bridgers:
  * `EthBridger`: For bridging ETH to and from an Arbitrum chain (L2 or L3)
  * `Erc20Bridger`: For bridging ERC-20 tokens to and from an Arbitrum chain (L2 or L3)
  * `EthL1L3Bridger`: For bridging ETH to an L3 directly from L1
  * `Erc20L1L3Bridger`: For bridging ERC-20 tokens to an L3 directly from L1


### Cross-Chain Messages
[](https://github.com/OffchainLabs/arbitrum-sdk#cross-chain-messages)
Cross-chain communication is handled through `ParentToChildMessage` and `ChildToParentMessage` classes. These encapsulate the lifecycle of messages sent between chains, typically created from transaction receipts that initiate cross-chain messages.
### Network Configuration
[](https://github.com/OffchainLabs/arbitrum-sdk#network-configuration)
The SDK comes preconfigured for Arbitrum One, Arbitrum Nova and Arbitrum Sepolia. Custom Arbitrum networks can be registered using `registerCustomArbitrumNetwork`, which is required before utilizing other SDK features.
## Usage
[](https://github.com/OffchainLabs/arbitrum-sdk#usage)
Here's a basic example of using the SDK to bridge ETH:
```
import { ethers } from 'ethers'
import { EthBridger, getArbitrumNetwork } from '@arbitrum/sdk'

async function bridgeEth(parentSigner: ethers.Signer, childChainId: number) {
  const childNetwork = await getArbitrumNetwork(childChainId)
  const ethBridger = new EthBridger(childNetwork)

  const deposit = await ethBridger.deposit({
    amount: ethers.utils.parseEther('0.1'),
    parentSigner,
  })

  const txReceipt = await deposit.wait()
  console.log(`Deposit initiated: ${txReceipt.transactionHash}`)
}
```

For more detailed usage examples and API references, please refer to the 
## Running Integration Tests
[](https://github.com/OffchainLabs/arbitrum-sdk#running-integration-tests)
  1. Set up a Nitro test node by following the instructions 
  2. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and update relevant environment variables.
  3. Generate the network configuration against your active Nitro test node:
```
yarn gen:network
```

  4. Execute the integration tests:
```
yarn test:integration
```
