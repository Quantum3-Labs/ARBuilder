# ERC6909 Multi-Token Implementation on Arbitrum Stylus
[](https://github.com/Oluwatobilobaoke/erc6909-with-arbitrum-stylus#erc6909-multi-token-implementation-on-arbitrum-stylus)
A gas-optimized implementation of the ERC6909 multi-token standard using Rust and Arbitrum Stylus SDK. This contract supports multiple token types within a single contract, similar to ERC1155 but with improved gas efficiency.
## 📍 Deployed Contract
[](https://github.com/Oluwatobilobaoke/erc6909-with-arbitrum-stylus#-deployed-contract)
  * **Network** : Arbitrum Sepolia Testnet
  * **Contract Address** : `0xac0a47055733d0bbcb64646bcb072169b0060448`


## 🚀 What's New in This Implementation
[](https://github.com/Oluwatobilobaoke/erc6909-with-arbitrum-stylus#-whats-new-in-this-implementation)
### Key Changes from Standard Template
[](https://github.com/Oluwatobilobaoke/erc6909-with-arbitrum-stylus#key-changes-from-standard-template)
  1. **Storage Optimization** : Uses `bytes32` instead of `string` for name/symbol (saves ~6KB)
  2. **Contract Size** : Optimized from 26.1 KiB to 20.3 KiB to fit deployment limits
  3. **Full ERC6909** : Complete multi-token standard implementation
  4. **Integration Scripts** : Ready-to-use TypeScript interaction scripts with Viem


## Overview
[](https://github.com/Oluwatobilobaoke/erc6909-with-arbitrum-stylus#overview)
ERC6909 is a multi-token standard that allows a single contract to manage multiple fungible tokens identified by unique IDs. Think of it as a more gas-efficient alternative to ERC1155, where each token ID represents a completely different token type (like Gold, Silver, Bronze tokens in a game).
### Why ERC6909?
[](https://github.com/Oluwatobilobaoke/erc6909-with-arbitrum-stylus#why-erc6909)
  * **Gas Efficiency** : ~40% cheaper than ERC1155 for transfers
  * **Simpler Storage** : More efficient storage layout
  * **Better DX** : Cleaner approval mechanism
  * **Reduced Complexity** : No need for batch operations overhead when not needed


## Features
[](https://github.com/Oluwatobilobaoke/erc6909-with-arbitrum-stylus#features)
  * ✅ **Multi-Token Management** - Unlimited token types with unique IDs
  * ✅ **Owner-Controlled Minting** - Only contract owner can mint new tokens
  * ✅ **Flexible Approvals** - Per-token-ID approvals and global operator permissions
  * ✅ **Full Transfer Support** - Direct transfers and delegated transfers via allowances
  * ✅ **Token Burning** - Users can burn their own tokens
  * ✅ **Gas Optimized** - Uses bytes32 for metadata, optimized storage patterns
  * ✅ **Comprehensive Events** - Transfer, Approval, and OperatorSet events

[](https://github.com/Oluwatobilobaoke/erc6909-with-arbitrum-stylus#contract-interface)
```
interface IERC6909 {
    // Initialization (one-time only)
    function initialize(bytes32 name, bytes32 symbol) external;
    
    // View functions
    function name() external view returns (bytes32);
    function symbol() external view returns (bytes32);
    function decimals() external view returns (uint8);
    function balanceOf(address owner, uint256 id) external view returns (uint256);
    function allowance(address owner, address spender, uint256 id) external view returns (uint256);
    function isOperator(address owner, address spender) external view returns (bool);
    
    // State-changing functions
    function mint(address to, uint256 id, uint256 value) external; // Owner only
    function transfer(address receiver, uint256 id, uint256 value) external;
    function transferFrom(address sender, address receiver, uint256 id, uint256 value) external;
    function approve(address spender, uint256 id, uint256 value) external;
    function setOperator(address spender, bool approved) external;
    function burn(uint256 id, uint256 value) external;
    
    // Events
    event Transfer(address indexed from, address indexed to, uint256 indexed id, uint256 value);
    event Approval(address indexed owner, address indexed spender, uint256 indexed id, uint256 value);
    event OperatorSet(address indexed owner, address indexed sender, bool approved);
}
```

## Interacting with the Contract
[](https://github.com/Oluwatobilobaoke/erc6909-with-arbitrum-stylus#interacting-with-the-contract)
### Using the Integration Scripts
[](https://github.com/Oluwatobilobaoke/erc6909-with-arbitrum-stylus#using-the-integration-scripts)
The `integration/` folder contains ready-to-use TypeScript scripts:
#### 1. Initialize Contract
[](https://github.com/Oluwatobilobaoke/erc6909-with-arbitrum-stylus#1-initialize-contract)
```
cd integration
bun run initialize

# Output:
# ✅ Contract initialized with name: MultiToken, symbol: MTK
```

#### 2. Mint Tokens
[](https://github.com/Oluwatobilobaoke/erc6909-with-arbitrum-stylus#2-mint-tokens)
```
bun run mint

# Mints:
# - 1000 Gold tokens (ID: 1)
# - 2000 Silver tokens (ID: 2)  
# - 5000 Bronze tokens (ID: 3)
```

#### 3. Transfer Tokens
[](https://github.com/Oluwatobilobaoke/erc6909-with-arbitrum-stylus#3-transfer-tokens)
```
# Update recipient address in transfer.ts first
bun run transfer

# Demonstrates:
# - Direct transfer
# - Approval & transferFrom
# - Operator assignment
# - Multi-token transfers
```

### Manual Interaction Example
[](https://github.com/Oluwatobilobaoke/erc6909-with-arbitrum-stylus#manual-interaction-example)
```
// Using Viem
import { createWalletClient, createPublicClient, http } from 'viem';
import { arbitrumSepolia } from 'viem/chains';

const walletClient = createWalletClient({
  chain: arbitrumSepolia,
  transport: http(),
});

// Initialize (one-time)
const hash = await walletClient.writeContract({
  address: '0xac0a47055733d0bbcb64646bcb072169b0060448',
  abi: erc6909Abi,
  functionName: 'initialize',
  args: [
    '0x4d79546f6b656e00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000', // "MyToken" as bytes32
    '0x4d544b0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000', // "MTK" as bytes32
  ],
});

// Mint tokens (owner only)
await walletClient.writeContract({
  address: contractAddress,
  abi: erc6909Abi,
  functionName: 'mint',
  args: [userAddress, 1n, 1000n], // Mint 1000 tokens of ID 1
});
```

## Key Optimizations Explained
[](https://github.com/Oluwatobilobaoke/erc6909-with-arbitrum-stylus#key-optimizations-explained)
### 1. Storage Optimization
[](https://github.com/Oluwatobilobaoke/erc6909-with-arbitrum-stylus#1-storage-optimization)
```
// Before: Dynamic strings (expensive)
sol_storage! {
    string name;
    string symbol;
}

// After: Fixed bytes32 (cheaper)
sol_storage! {
    bytes32 name;
    bytes32 symbol;
}
```

### 2. Test Code Removal
[](https://github.com/Oluwatobilobaoke/erc6909-with-arbitrum-stylus#2-test-code-removal)
```
// Development: Include tests
#[cfg(test)]
mod test {
    // 380+ lines of test code
}

// Production: Comment out for deployment
// #[cfg(test)]
// mod test { ... }
```

### 3. Import Optimization
[](https://github.com/Oluwatobilobaoke/erc6909-with-arbitrum-stylus#3-import-optimization)
```
// Only import what's needed
extern crate alloc;

use alloc::vec::Vec; // Required by SDK macros

### Storage Layout
[](https://github.com/Oluwatobilobaoke/erc6909-with-arbitrum-stylus#storage-layout)
```
sol_storage! {
    #[entrypoint]
    pub struct ERC6909 {
        address owner;                    // Contract owner
        bytes32 name;                      // Token collection name
        bytes32 symbol;                    // Token collection symbol
        uint8 decimals;                    // Always 18
        mapping(address => mapping(uint256 => uint256)) _balance;
        mapping(address => mapping(address => bool)) _operator_approvals;
        mapping(address => mapping(address => mapping(uint256 => uint256))) _allowances;
    }
}
```

### Internal Functions Pattern
[](https://github.com/Oluwatobilobaoke/erc6909-with-arbitrum-stylus#internal-functions-pattern)
```
impl ERC6909 {
    // Internal function (prefixed with _)
    fn _transfer(&mut self, from: Address, to: Address, id: U256, value: U256) 
        -> Result<(), ERC6909Error> {
        // Validation
        if from.is_zero() { return Err(...); }
        if to.is_zero() { return Err(...); }
        
        // Business logic
        self._update(from, to, id, value)?;
        Ok(())
    }
}

#[public]
impl ERC6909 {
    // Public function (calls internal)
    fn transfer(&mut self, receiver: Address, id: U256, value: U256) 
        -> Result<(), ERC6909Error> {
        self._transfer(self.vm().msg_sender(), receiver, id, value)
    }
}
```

## Gas Comparison
[](https://github.com/Oluwatobilobaoke/erc6909-with-arbitrum-stylus#gas-comparison)
Operation | ERC1155 | ERC6909 | Savings  
---|---|---|---  
Transfer | ~51,000 gas | ~30,000 gas | ~40%  
Approval | ~48,000 gas | ~28,000 gas | ~42%  
Mint | ~52,000 gas | ~32,000 gas | ~38%  
## Security Considerations
[](https://github.com/Oluwatobilobaoke/erc6909-with-arbitrum-stylus#security-considerations)
  1. **Access Control** : Only owner can mint tokens
  2. **Zero Address Protection** : Prevents accidental burns
  3. **Overflow Protection** : Built-in Rust safety
  4. **Reentrancy Safe** : No external calls in critical sections
  5. **Allowance Validation** : Proper spending checks


## Common Issues & Solutions
[](https://github.com/Oluwatobilobaoke/erc6909-with-arbitrum-stylus#common-issues--solutions)
### Issue: Contract Too Large
[](https://github.com/Oluwatobilobaoke/erc6909-with-arbitrum-stylus#issue-contract-too-large)
**Error** : `max code size exceeded`
**Solution** :
  * Remove test code for production
  * Use bytes32 instead of string
  * Minimize imports
  * Enable aggressive optimizations


### Issue: Transaction Fails
[](https://github.com/Oluwatobilobaoke/erc6909-with-arbitrum-stylus#issue-transaction-fails)
**Error** : `ERC6909InvalidSender`
**Solution** :
  * Ensure contract is initialized first
  * Check msg.sender is the owner for mint operations
  * Verify addresses are not zero addresses


## Future Improvements
[](https://github.com/Oluwatobilobaoke/erc6909-with-arbitrum-stylus#future-improvements)
  * Batch operations for multiple transfers
  * EIP-2612 permit for gasless approvals
  * Metadata URI per token ID
  * Pausable functionality
  * Total supply tracking
