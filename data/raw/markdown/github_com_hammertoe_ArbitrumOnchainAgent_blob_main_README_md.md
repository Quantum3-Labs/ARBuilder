# Arbitrum On-Chain AI Agent - Q-Learning Maze NFT Workshop
[](https://github.com/hammertoe/ArbitrumOnchainAgent/blob/main/README.md#arbitrum-on-chain-ai-agent---q-learning-maze-nft-workshop)
This repository demonstrates how to implement AI agents that execute directly on-chain using Arbitrum Stylus. The project was created as part of the ETHGlobal Agenttic Ethereum Hackathon, showcasing the potential of running AI algorithms directly within smart contracts.
## Why On-Chain AI?
[](https://github.com/hammertoe/ArbitrumOnchainAgent/blob/main/README.md#why-on-chain-ai)
While most current AI integrations with blockchain involve off-chain computation (typically using large language models) followed by on-chain actions, this project demonstrates a different approach: implementing the AI agent to run entirely on-chain. This opens up new possibilities for:
  * DEX hooks that analyze market conditions in real-time
  * Dynamic risk scoring for lending protocols
  * Price prediction mechanisms
  * Automated decision-making based on on-chain metrics


Our example uses Q-learning, a classic reinforcement learning algorithm, to demonstrate how an AI agent can learn and adapt within the constraints of a smart contract environment.
## Overview
[](https://github.com/hammertoe/ArbitrumOnchainAgent/blob/main/README.md#overview)
The smart contract implements a 5x5 maze where:
  * A Q-learning algorithm learns the optimal path from start to goal
  * The maze solution is visualized as an NFT using SVG
  * Each cell shows an arrow pointing to the next best move
  * The contract implements the ERC-721 standard for NFT compatibility

## Setup
[](https://github.com/hammertoe/ArbitrumOnchainAgent/blob/main/README.md#setup)
  1. First, set up your Rust and Stylus environment by following the 
  2. Clone this repository:


```
git clone https://github.com/hammertoe/ArbitrumOnchainAgent
cd ArbitrumOnchainAgent
```

## Deployment
[](https://github.com/hammertoe/ArbitrumOnchainAgent/blob/main/README.md#deployment)
  1. First, check that your contract compiles correctly:


```
cargo stylus check -e https://sepolia-rollup.arbitrum.io/rpc
```

  1. Deploy the contract (replace `${PRIVATE_KEY}` with your private key):


```
cargo stylus deploy -e https://sepolia-rollup.arbitrum.io/rpc --private-key ${PRIVATE_KEY} --no-verify
```

  1. Export the ABI for use with Remix:


```
cargo stylus export-abi --json --output contract.abi
```

## Interacting with the Contract
[](https://github.com/hammertoe/ArbitrumOnchainAgent/blob/main/README.md#interacting-with-the-contract)
Once deployed, you can interact with the contract using Remix:
  1. Import the ABI into Remix
  2. Connect to the deployed contract address
  3. Train the Q-learning algorithm using the `train` function
  4. Mint your NFT using the `mint` function
  5. View the learned path in your wallet!

## Contract Functions
[](https://github.com/hammertoe/ArbitrumOnchainAgent/blob/main/README.md#contract-functions)
  * `mint(address)`: Mint the NFT to a specified address
  * `train(episodes, max_steps, epsilon, alpha, gamma)`: Train the Q-learning algorithm
  * `token_uri()`: Generate the SVG visualization of the maze
  * Standard ERC-721 functions for NFT compatibility


## Technical Implementation
[](https://github.com/hammertoe/ArbitrumOnchainAgent/blob/main/README.md#technical-implementation)
This project uses Q-learning, a reinforcement learning algorithm, to solve a maze puzzle. The agent:
  1. Learns through trial and error
  2. Develops an optimal policy for navigating the maze
  3. Visualizes its learned solution as an NFT
  4. Runs entirely on-chain using Arbitrum Stylus


## Workshop Context
[](https://github.com/hammertoe/ArbitrumOnchainAgent/blob/main/README.md#workshop-context)
This project was developed for a workshop during the ETHGlobal Agenttic Ethereum Hackathon, where Arbitrum was a sponsor offering $10,000 in prizes for innovative projects built on Arbitrum. The workshop demonstrates how Arbitrum Stylus enables running sophisticated algorithms, including AI agents, directly on-chain.

  * Implementing reinforcement learning in smart contracts
  * Using Arbitrum Stylus for complex on-chain computation
  * Creating interactive NFTs that showcase AI behavior
