# EthBucharest 2025 - Gyges
[](https://github.com/philogicae/ethbuc2025-gyges#ethbucharest-2025---gyges)
Implementation of 
Why this game? Because nobody knows it and the rules seem to be simple on paper... but the game is actually complex and pretty deep when we take a closer look (like Go).
The duration of a game can go from 10 seconds to 2 hours, if the levels of the players are close.
As a solidity dev, it was the perfect opportunity to discover Arbitrum Stylus, refresh my Rust, and have fun with low-level optimizations (Yes it's FUN).
## How to play
[](https://github.com/philogicae/ethbuc2025-gyges#how-to-play)
Read the rules: 
## Stack
[](https://github.com/philogicae/ethbuc2025-gyges#stack)
  * Rust language
  * Some python/bash scripts as minimal CLI


## Notes
[](https://github.com/philogicae/ethbuc2025-gyges#notes)
Tbh I focused on understanding the specificities of Rust/Stylus and optimizing EVM storage (The state of the game fits on a single bytes32).
Didn't have time to:
  * Restrict paths properly: should not be able to pass by an occupied cell or a cell already used during the turn.
  * Placement restriction when 'flying' (after replacing a piece): can place a piece on any empty cell, but should not be able to go behind the opponent line.


## TODO's
[](https://github.com/philogicae/ethbuc2025-gyges#todos)
  * Improve the smart contract: 
    * Heavy refactoring
    * Add missing restrictions
    * Add winner check
  * Build the webUI (probably with React)
  * Add AI opponent using LLM agent
